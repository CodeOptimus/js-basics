6. Difference between dynamically typed and staticaly typed programming languages.

Dynamically-typed programming languages are languages that perform type checks at runtime, which means they run or compile even if they have errors in them.
eg; JavaScript, Groovy, Python, Lisp, PHP

Statically-typed programming languages are languages that perform type checking at compile time, they prevent the compilation if errors are present unless they are corrected. They also require that data types are declared before using them.
eg; Java, C, C++, C#, Swift, Kotlin, Fotran.
